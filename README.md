# Golang Mirror Extension

An extension to help make it easier to mirror Golang variables right away.

## For Example

Say that you have `{{ $TestExample := "Here is some text." }}`. When you copy and paste your code into the text area box, you can hit the button to generate `{{ $TestExample := $.TestExample }}`. This works for more than one at a time.

## Uploading Extensions

Go to your Manage Extensions and Load unpacked the folder of where the code is. You should be all set to test it out.
